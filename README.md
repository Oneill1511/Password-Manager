Personally, I can't stand the apple saved password manager. It never seems to load when i actually need it.
when it does it's usually saved the password from 2013 and hasn't kept track of new passwords.

i've built a localsied password manager which encrypts your passwords and requires a master password to access, it also creates a saved file with all your passwords outside of the bank which remain encrypted. 
It's pretty basic but i needed it during studies. can be saved to a usb giving you a portable password vault.
